Facial Recognition using Siamese Neural Networks

This is a facial recognition app built using Tensorflow and Kivy. The deep learning model used in this project is 
inspired from the paper : "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition"(https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf).
